Hi,
my name is Sebastian but when I'm online people call me zepp or zepptron because it's more electrifying!

I have no idea why you are here (and I don't care) but maybe my blogposts are interesting for you. Feel free to read and try out everything, it's all open source. Things will fail, everybody knows that. Ask me and I'll try to answer it. There is nothing here that tracks your behavior, no ads, videos, music or whatever you might want to block. It's just some stuff I wanted to write down so anyone who wants to do the same can benefit from it. Sooner or later I'll add some photos but right now I'm not really good at it.
