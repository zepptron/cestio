Hi,

This blog is a funproject, hosted on a few Raspberry Pis. From time to time there will be new features, mostly in the backend, you'll find blogposts about that asap. Doing it for the lulz, to challenge myself and to publish some of the stuff I'm doing. I know the internet is already full of tutorials and how-tos etc but it's always the same: if you need something, you won't find it anywhere. Thats why I build this site, to fill some of the gaps, to document some of my stuff and to play around with Docker Swarm and some other interesting projects on Raspberry Pi.

The picture shows the datacenter of this website. Small, fast, cheap and reliable. If you're interested and my blogposts aren't enough join me on slack and feel free to start a discussion. If you're just interested in scripts and code you should check out my github account. You can find the links on the left and at the bottom.
