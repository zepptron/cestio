      <title>Prometheus: Docker metrics</title>

      <description>Socat for Docker Swarm on Raspberry Pi
You&amp;rsquo;ll need this if youâ€˜d like to get the metrics of the docker daemon into prometheus. Since every docker installation has it&amp;rsquo;s own metrics you&amp;rsquo;ll need something small between your running daemon and prometheus to differentiate and not only get the ones from the hostmachine where prometheus is actually running.
Thats what we want to achieve: graph LR; A[Prometheus]--|TCP listen| B(socat#1) A[Prometheus]--|TCP listen| C(socat#2) A[Prometheus]--|TCP listen| D(socat#n) B -- |Output| F[DockerD#1] C -- |Output| G[DockerD#2] D -- |Output| H[DockerD#n]  Prerequisites: Please take care that you have the correct docker_gwbridge IP in use if you&amp;rsquo;re about to use it in the docker daemon/prometheus context.</description>

      <description>Since vinyl is getting bigger and bigger these days and lots of people have some old players somewhere in their cellar it might be usefull to read the following lines in order to upgrade it to something thats fits for the 21st century. Most of the time the &amp;ldquo;new generation players&amp;rdquo; don&amp;rsquo;t have the quality you&amp;rsquo;d expect when you compare them to some old models. You might also want to place your vinylplayer somewhere in the corner of your room and not next to your TV just to be able to plug it into your amplifier via the short cable.</description>
